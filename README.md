### Basics of Executing a MERN Stack Project

A MERN (MongoDB, Express.js,ejs, Node.js) stack project involves both frontend and backend development. Here's a basic guide to executing a MERN stack project:

1. **Setting Up the Project**
   - **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
     cd repo-name
     ```

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
   - **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the backend directory (if separated) and install the necessary packages.
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file to store environment variables such as database URIs, API keys, and ports.
     ```bash
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     PORT=5000
     ```
   - **Run the Server**: Start the Node.js server.
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

3. **Frontend (React.js)**
   - **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the frontend directory and install React dependencies.
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Run the React App**: Start the React development server.
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     The frontend will usually run on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Connecting Frontend and Backend**
   - Ensure the frontend makes API requests to the correct backend URL, typically something like `http://localhost:5000/api/`.

5. **Running Both Frontend and Backend**
   - You can either run the frontend and backend separately or use a tool like `concurrently` to run both with a single command.
     ```bash
     npm install concurrently --save-dev
     ```
     Then modify your root `package.json` scripts:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
       "server": "cd backend && npm start",
       "client": "cd frontend && npm start"
     }
     ```

6. **Building for Production**
   - **Frontend**: Create a production build of the React app.
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - **Backend**: Serve the built React app using Express in production.

### Intro of YelpCamp for GitHub Repository

```markdown
## YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application designed to allow users to browse, review, and manage campgrounds. Built with the MERN stack, YelpCamp offers a robust and interactive experience, featuring:

- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration using Passport.js.
- **Interactive Maps**: Integration with Mapbox for displaying campground locations on an interactive map.
- **Campground Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete their own campgrounds.
- **Review System**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for campgrounds.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly interface built with modern CSS techniques.

### Tech Stack

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing campground and user data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework to build a RESTful API.
- **ejs**: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for handling server-side operations.

This project demonstrates a range of skills including frontend development, backend API creation, database management, and user authentication.
